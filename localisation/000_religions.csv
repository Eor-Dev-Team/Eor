cohortist_DESC;The Cthori, or "Hearers of the Cohorts", take their name from the Cohorts, Ishdad the Immortal's closest friends. They adhere to the scriptures, rituals, and beliefs handed down by those ancient Elves, in an unbroken line from Ishdad himself. They believe that the Ishdadites enjoy the special blessing of heaven, and consequently must rise to become worthy of it. They emphasise the perfection of the self, especially by the mastery of magic, which they believe to be the special heritage of the Elves. They are proficient in Fire, Light, and Water magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cserian;Cserian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cserian_DESC;The Cserian faith believes that Ishdad did not bestow spiritual authority on his Cohorts, but instead on his wife Cseri. They have long been persecuted by the mainstream Cthori, who view them as deviants following a woman who did not even want to be worshipped. They have become secretive and focus heavily on mystical contemplation of the universe, seeking enlightenment. They have adopted many practices not found among the Cthori, such as ecstatic meditation, claiming that Ishdad speaks to them regularly, and that his spirit reincarnates into their spirital leaders. They are skilled in Fire, Shadow, Water, and Astral magic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
