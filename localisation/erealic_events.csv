TITLE_antanian_restoration;The Kingdom of Antania;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_antanian_restoration;The Antanian peninsula has long been the home of the fiercely independent calugian people. Legends say that a man named Calugius, the chief of a minor migrating tribe, came upon the lush and fertile lands of the peninsula, and told his people to settle there. The people of Antania claim descent from these first settlers, and call themselves Calugians in honor of their chief. In the not-too-distant past, Antania had been united under a strong Kingdom. However, time took its toll on the state, and eventually the provinces grew so powerful and independent that they refused to acknowledge the monarch. Antania fell not with a bang, but a mere whimper. However, you have managed to unify the region under your rule. It is clear that a capable monarch once again sits upon the Antanian throne.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
