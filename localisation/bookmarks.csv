BM_LAURENTIA_ERA;Shards of Glass;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LAURENTIA_ERA_INFO;The Antanian peninsula, home to the Calugian elves, lies to the far northwestern corner of the continent, almost at the edge of the known world. The region was united under a powerful kingdom ruled by the Vernian Dynasty. The kingdom reached its height during the rule of Suphre Vernianus, an able administrator and a brave warrior. However, due to gross mismanagement of the realm by later monarchs, the provinces grew more and more autonomous, until the Antanian monarch ruled them in name only. This too ended when a disastrous coup shattered the illusion of a united kingdom, and resulted in most provinces officially declaring the monarchy defunct, and asserting their independence. Antania shattered into countless tiny pieces, like shards of broken glass. The future of the region has never been so uncertain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ERA_CHAR_INFO_2903;Lanea is a direct descendant of Suphre, the renowned queen of Antania. Suphre was known for her competent administration of the realm during her rule, but what ultimately elevated her to near-legendary status was her leadership during times of war. When Antania faced the threat of invasion, she took up arms personally, quite rare for elven rulers, and with little formal training in warfare at that. Against all odds, victory was achieved, and songs were sung of her bravery. Her descendant, though no longer the ruler of all Antania, wishes to uphold Suphre's legacy, and seeks to emulate the legendary ruler. For this reason, she has been labelled the next "Suphre" by many of her compatriots. Will she be able to live up to her predecessor's legacy, and bring about a golden age for the calugians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2910;The duchy of Greater Massia was one of the foremost powers in the region after the collapse of the Antanian Kingdom. That is, until the duchy itself collapsed. The King Urcinarus was killed in cold blood by his daughter, Sénéa, who usurped the duchy by the sword. Her siblings, who were provincial governors, did not take kindly to this, of course. They managed to take the capital from her, leaving Sénéa with only the easternmost province of the duchy, but the siblings soon had a falling out over who among them would rule Greater Massia. The stage is set for the final conflict that will decide the fate of the duchy, and quite possibly the fate of Antania.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2909;Nevrus, an ereal ruler in the calugian heartland, is an anomaly. He inadventently rose to power due to a distant relation to a minor calugian count who died without a suitable heir. The man himself was more interested in poring over books than tending to matters of administration. The calugians are not known to take kindly to outsiders, and it was with great reluctance that the nobles of Typerium chose him. Despite this, will be able to bring prosperity and leadership to Antania? Can he eventually earn the respect, and even admiration, of the calugian people? Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2912;Phresus was originally a minor officer in the Antanian army. He was stationed at the very capital of the kingdom, Numeum. By his time, most of the peninsula was effectively independent from Antanian rule, and soon the rump state finally and "officially" dissolved. In the confusion of the collapse, Phresus managed to steal the valuable crown of Antania, and fled westwards, where he eventually rose to power as the minor count of the province of Phomerium. The crown may be in his possession, but the kingdom that comes with it lies in pieces. It is up to him to change that.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2901;In a bygone era, the monarchs of Antania used to appoint a Protector, who was granted governorship of the borderlands of Antania, and tasked with protecting the heart of the kingdom from outside invasions and opportunistic raids. While the kingdom may be no more, the memory of the Protector still survives. Thus, when the border marches were united under a duke, all of Antania looked upto the "Protector" to, if not actively defend, then at least act as a buffer between the peninsula and the outside world, and to prevent the latter from meddling in the affairs of the Calugians. This task has now fallen upon the shoulders of Phomeus, of House Celphernian. However, rising threats in the borderlands raise a question that demands an answer: Will Phomeus even be able to protect his own realm, much less that of all Calugians?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ERA_CHAR_INFO_2902;Quentus Druséané was a renowned commander of the Antanian armies. After the collapse of royal authority, Quentus consolidated his hold over the province he and his army were stationed in. Later in his life, a vicious rivalry grew between him and Glapeus Gordéana, a neighbouring ruler, due to border conflicts. More than one skirmish was fought between the troops of Quentus and Glapeus, with neither managing to decisively defeat the other. Will the former commander defeat his rival, and eventually unite the peninsula under the banner of Antania? ;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
